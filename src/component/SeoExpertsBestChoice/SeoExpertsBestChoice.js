                  The age of the phone book is at an end. And there are no two
                  ways about it. According to a Harris Interactive poll, 60% of
                  people from the U.S. use the internet to find contact
                  information.

                <p className="innovate-list-para">
                  The internet is a big part of people’s lives nowadays, with
                  almost 236.5 million users accessing search services from
                  search engines. What’s staggering is that a vast majority of
                  these searches, about 89% of the total searches on the
                  internet, are made for informing purchase decisions. In
                  comparison, 71% of business purchase decisions result from it.

                  Just like marketing teams in the U.S. spending over $80
                  billion dollars on SEO services this year, you should also
                  contemplate investing in it for successful digital marketing
                  strategies. But how does one succeed at it? For any business,
                  two conventional routes exist – either they outsource the SEO
                  project to an external agency, or hire a dedicated SEO
                  consultant offshore and keep the control.
                </p>
                <p className="innovate-list-para">
                  A recent trend that has gained traction is that of businesses
                  outsourcing their SEO capabilities to agencies, with as many
                  as 67% of organizations having been reported to do so.
                  However, this practice is usually ill-informed, and they don’t
                  take into account their market, particular situation, and
                  target audiences.
                </p>
                <p className="innovate-list-para">
                  Here, we will take a look at the reasons why.
                </p>
                <h5> Problems with Outsourcing SEO</h5>
                <p className="innovate-list-para">
                  A lot of businesses straightaway jump on the white-label SEO
                  partners bandwagon. However, in this process, they tend to
                  lose big on resources and results achieved. Let’s see how.

                <ul className="list-style">

                      <h5> Communication</h5>
                      <p className="innovate-list-para">
                        Any time you outsource any job to an external agency,
                        communication takes a hit because the business process
                        doesn’t take place under your roof. So much so that a
                        study by the Outsourcing Center revealed that 16% of
                        outsourced projects fail is because of poor
                        communication.

                      <p className="innovate-list-para">
                        Outsourcing comes with a general sense of foreboding
                        because of the reasons mentioned above. Add to that, a
                        lack of transparency and what awaits businesses is
                        nothing but lost revenue. This is such a big quandary
                        for organizations that 10% of them attributed their
                        unwillingness to outsource to lack of transparency.

                        Much like SEO is only one part of your broader focus
                        areas, you’re only one client of the several that an
                        agency has, and many a time, their work might not be as
                        comprehensive as you want if you are choosing the shared

                        Should you hire a professional SEO Expert offshore as an

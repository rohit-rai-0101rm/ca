                Using the power of Psychology, we make sure to be aesthetically
                pleasing for first time interactions.

            <div className="coloring2"> <strong><i>#Pre-interview Assessments -</i></strong>if you want any talents to take any additional assessment to better judge their technical capabilities, you can share your tests and the candidate would be more than willing to complete them.</div>

            <br />
            <p>Because every talent is pre-vetted against their communication skills, technical capabilities, and more, we reduce the guesswork and the probability of a wrong hire drastically.</p>
            <br />
            <p>This helps even non-technical managers/interviewers to assess the talents mainly on the VIBE check.</p>

            <div className="coloring2"> <strong><i>#No Risk Trial -</i> </strong>We have the option where the talent can work for up to 2 weeks (based on availability), which allows many clients to gain more trust and confidence to decide on hiring, in the case where the clients are in two minds after the interview.</div>

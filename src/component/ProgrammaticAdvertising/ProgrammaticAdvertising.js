                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    The programmatic advertising system has streamlined the
                    online ads' buying and selling process. It's more efficient
                    than before because it can automate many steps in a process
                    that would have been carried out manually, such as ordering
                    or setting up your campaign. Simply put, it's meant to
                    replace human intervention with machine learning and
                    AI-based optimization.

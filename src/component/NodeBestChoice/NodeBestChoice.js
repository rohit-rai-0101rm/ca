                <p className="innovate-list-para">
                  NodeJS is a popular open-source back-end JavaScript runtime
                  environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript
                  code outside a web browser.

                      <p className="innovate-list-para">
                        Node.js can create real-time applications that process a
                        high volume of short messages and require a minimum
                        delay. For example, Yahoo, LinkedIn, and Uber are built
                        on NodeJS.

                        This is an actual strength of NodeJS because it allows
                        building applications that can quickly grow with your
                        company. NodeJS works great in systems that use
                        microservices architecture, where scalability and
                        versatility can be achieved rapidly and efficiently.

                        Many developers use NodeJS for web development as it
                        doesn't need a lot of investment. Research has shown
                        that organizations using NodeJS for web development
                        consume less computing power for hosting.

                        NodeJS is a cross-platform, saving programmers time and
                        allowing them to build applications faster. One of the
                        essential advantages of using NodeJS to develop web
                        applications is that it contains a lot of open-source
                        libraries.

                      NodeJS is easy to learn. However, it requires more time to execute web applications. What makes it difficult is the equal programming that runs the non-blocking code. This doesn't prevent the execution of a piece of code. That is the reason it is hard to program.

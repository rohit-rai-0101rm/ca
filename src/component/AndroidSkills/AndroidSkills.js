                      I do not lecture to a non-technical audience but prefer to use the Socratic Way as far as possible. This gets them to think like a coder in a step-by-step rather than intuitive manner.

                      However, it is difficult. The first meeting, when I do not know the clients and their ability to understand tech, is always tentative. The second meeting is far smoother since I know how much I have to explain and from what angle.

                      First of all, I have never approved of the Apple platform and its closed system. I believe in GNU, public software, and open source. I respect Android engineers since they allow development of forks such as FireOS for Amazon.

                      Secondly, I have never used an Apple product since they are quite high priced. I have no comfort in that zone and became a dedicated Android developer. Any Android app (except gaming) can run in a $70 Galaxy M01 and a $1500 Galaxy S22 with equal ease.

                      Thirdly, from a purely coding point of view, if I was required to learn Swift and iOS SDK, I would certainly do so. I am not completely unaware of it, but I can’t sit down tomorrow and code in Swift.

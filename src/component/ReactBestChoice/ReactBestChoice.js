                <p className="innovate-list-para">
                  ReactJS is a JavaScript library built by Facebook engineers as
                  their primary organizational tool. A survey conducted in 2019
                  by Stack Overflow revealed that 74.5% of the developers in the
                  world prefer ReactJS development services when creating
                  front-end applications.
                  <br />
                  Here comes the question of why everybody has gone crazy over
                  the framework, fascinated by the features, and impressed by
                  the offerings. Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that
                  ReactJS is one of the fastest-growing frameworks. Still, why
                  would you use ReactJS?

                  Below is the list of top reasons to choose ReactJS for web
                  development.
                </h5>

                      <h5> Plain & Simple Learning Curve</h5>
                      <p className="innovate-list-para">One thing that stops developers from using new technology is the time and effort needed to learn. To save you from this pain, ReactJS comes with an easy-to-learn interface. Regardless of what you have been working on, ReactJS is pretty simple, and if you have some decent JavaScript knowledge, you will be fine with ReactJS.</p>

                      <h5> Exceptional Reusability</h5>
                      <p className="innovate-list-para">It's always good to start by building components and including them within your application. To stand out in the industry, everyone wants to display customization and keep their approach unique. Modular applications often have thousands of small modules, and coding each of them isn't feasible. As a result, ReactJS web developers can reuse their existing components throughout the app. For instance:- If you open Amazon's website from India, a different logo will appear, and if you open the website from the US, the logo will be different, which can be done by reusing the component codes.</p>

                      <h5>Rich Ecosystem Of Developers & Tools</h5>
                      <p className="innovate-list-para">ReactJS has a thriving ecosystem and has built-in tools that facilitate the creation, design, and development of applications. Utilizing ready-made charts, graphics, modules, and documentation tools, developers can shorten the overall development time. Best of all, the tools are technically rich and cover all functionalities that must be included in the application. It seems ReactJS is the best choice for organizations seeking to build the app without re-engineering it.</p>

                      <p className="innovate-list-para">The advantages of using ReactJS for the web development of a front-end application are enormous, including scalability, high-end applications, superfast performance, and many more. In the world of front-end development frameworks, ReactJS is a hot topic. Nevertheless, it can only be used for certain types of projects. Before hiring ReactJS developers, we recommend assessing and analyzing the project requirements.</p>

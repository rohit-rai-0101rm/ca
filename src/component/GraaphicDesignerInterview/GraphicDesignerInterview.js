                  When we talk about graphic designing, nothing is definite. The
                  design is a beautiful amalgamation of a client’s requirement
                  and a designer’s creativity until it goes into the hands of a
                  developer!

                  As a designer, you cannot restrict your creativity to each
                  best practice advice catered for the website layout design,
                  but at the same time, you need to consider the factors
                  encountered by a developer, including- design compatibility
                  over different screens and the time limits.

                  Developers often encounter a great share of frustration while
                  bringing a design to life especially when making it compatible
                  with various mobile platforms. However, there are website
                  layout design techniques with which a graphic designer can
                  help the developer develop a website faster.

                  <h5>1. Mark Your Grid and Know Your Boundaries</h5>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    Before starting with the graphic designing, you need to mark
                    your global boundaries and establish the grid structure you
                    will be following for the entire design. Popular front-end
                    frameworks like Bootstrap and the 960 Grid offer a 12-column
                    grid system that can be opted for creating perfectly
                    measured designs appreciated by developers.
                  </p>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    <strong>Reason: </strong>
                    In the 1st case when no grid rule is followed, it is
                    difficult for the developers to define the content block
                    sizes for a pixel-perfect design and the process is
                    time-consuming. They have to evaluate and position each
                    design element individually without an accurate idea of its
                    positioning.
                  </p>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    While, in the 2nd case where the graphic designer has
                    followed the 12-column grid system of Bootstrap, the
                    developer saves up to 30% of his efforts and time.
                  </p>
                  <h5>2. Irregular Curves Are A Strict 'No'</h5>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    Graphic Designers love to break the monotony of regular
                    shapes with innovative shapes and design elements that are
                    likely to polarize. However, they must avoid the use of
                    irregular curve elements (like the ones shown in the 1st
                    case), unless absolutely necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    <strong>Reason: </strong>A curve is defined by a
                    mathematical equation between two mouse positions, and
                    therefore an irregular curve is likely to come up as a
                    challenge on the development side. An irregular curve (as
                    shown in the 1st case) is not supported readily in CSS and
                    HTML. To employ this type of website layout design, a
                    developer needs to call an image file in the code, thus
                    fading design flexibility. Irregular curves can take up to
                    50% more time to develop a certain section, as compared to
                    regular curves. You should generally go with regular shapes
                    as shown in the 2nd case.

                    3. Avoid Getting Into The Complexity of Multiple Layers
                  </h5>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    Graphic Designers like to explore their creativity and,
                    thus, sometimes they compromise standard practices. It may
                    be by making variations in the content block size, breaking
                    the alignment, or by overlaying effects. These practices
                    often result in increased complexity at the developer-end
                    and should be avoided.{" "}
                  </p>

                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    <strong>Reason: </strong>
                    When a translucent effect layer overlays the primary layer
                    (as shown in the 1st case), the flexibility of the design
                    over different screen sizes is compromised up to a
                    significant extent. With this, on one end where the blocks
                    in the primary layer adjust automatically according to
                    changing screen sizes, on the other, the translucent layer
                    needs to be positioned manually through coding. Therefore,
                    it is preferred to keep things in flow as in the 2nd case.
                  </p>

                  <h5 className="mt--60">
                    4. Similar Sections Should Be of The Same Size
                  </h5>

                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    Alignments and measurements are to be strictly followed! One
                    of the most common mistakes that graphic designers tend to
                    make is failing to meet the measurement accuracy demanded by
                    a pixel-perfect design. While designing similar design
                    sections for different web pages, the section sizes and
                    measurements should be exactly the same.
                  </p>

                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    <strong>Reason: </strong>
                    To create a website layout design that complies with the
                    standards of a pixel-perfect design, an HTML developer needs
                    to pay thorough attention to its consistency and measurement
                    accuracy. Therefore, while creating similar design sections
                    for multiple web pages of the same website, you are expected
                    to follow high design accuracy, and hire a graphic designer
                    from India to do the job. In this case, a developer has to
                    define the similar design section just once in a master
                    class and can call it smartly on various web pages. Thus
                    saving time and meeting the accuracy.

                    5. Consistent Website and Mobile Design Is A Must!
                  </h5>
                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    As with the increasing internet usage rate through the
                    mobile platform, responsive design is not a luxury anymore,
                    but a necessity. Therefore, a graphic designer needs to be
                    highly particular about the design elements and the
                    alignment of images he uses in his design. The design
                    elements used in the web design should be similar to that
                    used in its mobile version.
                  </p>

                  <p className="innovate-list-para">
                    <strong>Reason: </strong>
                    Following the standard practice of creating the desktop
                    design first and then moving onto the mobile part of it,
                    many designers fail to consider the visual similarity
                    between the two. In this case, when the desktop design is
                    handed over to an HTML developer he is unable to position
                    the design elements accurately for the mobile screens. Thus,
                    resulting in a disconnected design over different screen
                    sizes.

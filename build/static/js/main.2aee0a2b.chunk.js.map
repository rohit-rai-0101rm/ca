If you’re not happy with the designs at this stage, you will pay us in full for all of the work that we have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission us to make further design revisions at our standard design rates.</p>\r\n                                    <h3>Getting Down To The Nitty Gritty</h3>\r\n                                    <h4>Design</h4>\r\n                                    <p>If we are designing your application we’ll create designs for the look-and-feel, layout and functionality of your website.

The landscape of web browsers and devices changes regularly and our approach is to look forward, not back. With that in mind we will test all our markup and CSS in current versions of all major desktop browsers to ensure that we make the most from them. Users of older or less capable browsers or devices will experience a design that is appropriate to the capabilities of their software. We do not cater for people using Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 or lower and cannot predict the behaviour of that browser. We will also test that these templates perform well on Apple’s iPad.</p>\r\n                                    <p className='mb-4'>We will not test old or abandoned browsers, for example Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 or 6 for Windows or Mac, previous versions of Apple’s Safari, Mozilla Firefox or Opera unless otherwise specified. If you need us to consider these older browsers, we will charge you at our standard old browser rate for any necessary additional design work, development and testing.</p>\r\n                                    <h4>Text Content</h4>\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>We may have written a best-seller but we’re not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy unless we specified it in the original estimate. We’ll be happy to help though, and in addition to the estimate we will charge you at our standard copy writing or content input rate.</p>\r\n                                    <h4>Photographs</h4>\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>You will supply us photographs in digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs we can suggest vendors of stock photography. Any time we spend searching for appropriate photographs will be charged at our standard discovery rate.</p>\r\n                                    <h4>Changes and Revisions</h4>\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>We know from plenty of experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your first idea about how something should look, or how it might work. We don’t want to limit either your options or your opportunities to change your mind.</p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>The estimate/quotation prices at the beginning of this document are based on the amount of work we estimate we’ll need to accomplish everything that you have told us you want to achieve. If you do want to change your mind, add extra pages or templates or even add new functionality, that won’t be a problem. However, you will be charged accordingly and these additional costs will need to be agreed to before the extra work commences. This additional work will affect deadlines and they will be moved accordingly. We’ll be up front about all of this if and when it happens to make sure we’re all on the same page before proceeding. We may also ask you to put requests in writing so we can keep track of changes. If the nature or functions of the project change significantly throughout the process, we reserve the right to deem the current project cancelled. At this point you will pay us in full for all the work we have done and may commission us to complete the new project based on the new requirements. This will require a new quote and contract.</p>\r\n                                    <h4>Technical Support</h4>\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>You may already have professional website hosting, you might even manage that hosting in-house; if that’s the case, great. If you don’t manage your own website hosting, or your current hosting environment does not support the solution we are providing, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred, third-party hosting providers. We will charge you a one-off fee for installing your site on this server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics, then the updates to, and management of that server, plus any support issues will be up to you.</p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>We are not a website hosting company and so do not offer or include technical support for website hosting, email or other services relating to website hosting.</p>\r\n                                    <h4>Legal stuff</h4>\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>We can’t guarantee that the functions contained in any web page templates or in a completed website will always be error-free and so we can’t be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate this website and any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.</p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\r\n                                    <h4>Copyrights</h4>\r\n\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>You guarantee to us that any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork that you provide us for inclusion in the website are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.</p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>When we receive your final payment, copyright is automatically assigned as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n                                    <p className='mb-3'>You own the graphics and other visual elements that we create for you for this project.

To stand out in the industry, everyone wants to display customization and keep their approach unique. Modular applications often have thousands of small modules, and coding each of them isn't feasible. As a result, ReactJS web developers can reuse their existing components throughout the app. For instance:- If you open Amazon's website from India, a different logo will appear, and if you open the website from the US, the logo will be different, which can be done by reusing the component codes.</p>\r\n                    </strong>\r\n                  </li>\r\n                  <li>\r\n                  <strong className=\"innovate-list-para\">\r\n                      <h5>Rich Ecosystem Of Developers & Tools</h5>\r\n                      <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">ReactJS has a thriving ecosystem and has built-in tools that facilitate the creation, design, and development of applications.

Popular front-end\r\n                    frameworks like Bootstrap and the 960 Grid offer a 12-column\r\n                    grid system that can be opted for creating perfectly\r\n                    measured designs appreciated by developers.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\r\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>\r\n                    In the 1st case when no grid rule is followed, it is\r\n                    difficult for the developers to define the content block\r\n                    sizes for a pixel-perfect design and the process is\r\n                    time-consuming. They have to evaluate and position each\r\n                    design element individually without an accurate idea of its\r\n                    positioning.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\r\n                    While, in the 2nd case where the graphic designer has\r\n                    followed the 12-column grid system of Bootstrap, the\r\n                    developer saves up to 30% of his efforts and time.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <h5>2. Irregular Curves Are A Strict 'No'</h5>\r\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\r\n                    Graphic Designers love to break the monotony of regular\r\n                    shapes with innovative shapes and design elements that are\r\n                    likely to polarize. However, they must avoid the use of\r\n                    irregular curve elements (like the ones shown in the 1st\r\n                    case), unless absolutely necessary.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\r\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>A curve is defined by a\r\n                    mathematical equation between two mouse positions, and\r\n                    therefore an irregular curve is likely to come up as a\r\n                    challenge on the development side. An irregular curve (as\r\n                    shown in the 1st case) is not supported readily in CSS and\r\n                    HTML. To employ this type of website layout design, a\r\n                    developer needs to call an image file in the code, thus\r\n                    fading design flexibility. Irregular curves can take up to\r\n                    50% more time to develop a certain section, as compared to\r\n                    regular curves. You should generally go with regular shapes\r\n                    as shown in the 2nd case.\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <h5 className=\"mt--60\">\r\n                    3.

These practices\r\n                    often result in increased complexity at the developer-end\r\n                    and should be avoided.{\" \"}\r\n                  </p>\r\n\r\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\r\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>\r\n                    When a translucent effect layer overlays the primary layer\r\n                    (as shown in the 1st case), the flexibility of the design\r\n                    over different screen sizes is compromised up to a\r\n                    significant extent.

Therefore, while creating similar design sections\r\n                    for multiple web pages of the same website, you are expected\r\n                    to follow high design accuracy, and hire a graphic designer\r\n                    from India to do the job.

To stand out in\n                        the industry, everyone wants to display customization\n                        and keep their approach unique. Modular applications\n                        often have thousands of small modules, and coding each\n                        of them isn't feasible. As a result, ReactJS web\n                        developers can reuse their existing components\n                        throughout the app. For instance:- If you open Amazon's\n                        website from India, a different logo will appear, and if\n                        you open the website from the US, the logo will be\n                        different, which can be done by reusing the component\n                        codes.\n                      </p>\n                    </strong>\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    <strong className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                      <h5>Git</h5>\n                      <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                        ReactJS has a thriving ecosystem and has built-in tools\n                        that facilitate the creation, design, and development of\n                        applications.

However, there are website\n                  layout design techniques with which a graphic designer can\n                  help the developer develop a website faster.\n                </p>\n                <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                  So we at Uplers, have screened our profound web development\n                  experience to throw light upon some essential website layout\n                  design tips to make development-friendly designs:\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"col-md-12 col-sm-6 mb--30\">\n                  <h5>1. Mark Your Grid and Know Your Boundaries</h5>\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    Before starting with the graphic designing, you need to mark\n                    your global boundaries and establish the grid structure you\n                    will be following for the entire design. Popular front-end\n                    frameworks like Bootstrap and the 960 Grid offer a 12-column\n                    grid system that can be opted for creating perfectly\n                    measured designs appreciated by developers.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>\n                    In the 1st case when no grid rule is followed, it is\n                    difficult for the developers to define the content block\n                    sizes for a pixel-perfect design and the process is\n                    time-consuming. They have to evaluate and position each\n                    design element individually without an accurate idea of its\n                    positioning.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    While, in the 2nd case where the graphic designer has\n                    followed the 12-column grid system of Bootstrap, the\n                    developer saves up to 30% of his efforts and time.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5>2. Irregular Curves Are A Strict 'No'</h5>\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    Graphic Designers love to break the monotony of regular\n                    shapes with innovative shapes and design elements that are\n                    likely to polarize. However, they must avoid the use of\n                    irregular curve elements (like the ones shown in the 1st\n                    case), unless absolutely necessary.\n                  </p>\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>A curve is defined by a\n                    mathematical equation between two mouse positions, and\n                    therefore an irregular curve is likely to come up as a\n                    challenge on the development side. An irregular curve (as\n                    shown in the 1st case) is not supported readily in CSS and\n                    HTML. To employ this type of website layout design, a\n                    developer needs to call an image file in the code, thus\n                    fading design flexibility. Irregular curves can take up to\n                    50% more time to develop a certain section, as compared to\n                    regular curves. You should generally go with regular shapes\n                    as shown in the 2nd case.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <h5 className=\"mt--60\">\n                    3. Avoid Getting Into The Complexity of Multiple Layers\n                  </h5>\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    Graphic Designers like to explore their creativity and,\n                    thus, sometimes they compromise standard practices. It may\n                    be by making variations in the content block size, breaking\n                    the alignment, or by overlaying effects. These practices\n                    often result in increased complexity at the developer-end\n                    and should be avoided.{\" \"}\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>\n                    When a translucent effect layer overlays the primary layer\n                    (as shown in the 1st case), the flexibility of the design\n                    over different screen sizes is compromised up to a\n                    significant extent. With this, on one end where the blocks\n                    in the primary layer adjust automatically according to\n                    changing screen sizes, on the other, the translucent layer\n                    needs to be positioned manually through coding. Therefore,\n                    it is preferred to keep things in flow as in the 2nd case.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <h5 className=\"mt--60\">\n                    4.

One\n                    of the most common mistakes that graphic designers tend to\n                    make is failing to meet the measurement accuracy demanded by\n                    a pixel-perfect design. While designing similar design\n                    sections for different web pages, the section sizes and\n                    measurements should be exactly the same.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>\n                    To create a website layout design that complies with the\n                    standards of a pixel-perfect design, an HTML developer needs\n                    to pay thorough attention to its consistency and measurement\n                    accuracy. Therefore, while creating similar design sections\n                    for multiple web pages of the same website, you are expected\n                    to follow high design accuracy, and hire a graphic designer\n                    from India to do the job. In this case, a developer has to\n                    define the similar design section just once in a master\n                    class and can call it smartly on various web pages. Thus\n                    saving time and meeting the accuracy.\n                  </p>\n                  <h5 className=\"mt--60\">\n                    5.

Therefore, a graphic designer needs to be\n                    highly particular about the design elements and the\n                    alignment of images he uses in his design. The design\n                    elements used in the web design should be similar to that\n                    used in its mobile version.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                    <strong>Reason: </strong>\n                    Following the standard practice of creating the desktop\n                    design first and then moving onto the mobile part of it,\n                    many designers fail to consider the visual similarity\n                    between the two. In this case, when the desktop design is\n                    handed over to an HTML developer he is unable to position\n                    the design elements accurately for the mobile screens.

I worked on adding and improving payment gateways. We introduced a “Share Bill” functionality using which two riders could split the payment.\n                      </p>\n                      <p className=\"innovate-list-para\">\n                      I also took part in pilot code writing for postpaid users who would have a billing cycle.
